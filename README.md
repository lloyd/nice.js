## nice.js

nice.js is a tiny library that lets you give the javascript render thread
some time to exectute when doing computationally expensive things.

See demo.html for details

## 3rd party code

the stuff under `stuff/` is third party code, only included to let the
demo run a realistic computational workload.  That stuff is not mine,
and isn't required to use `nice.js`.
